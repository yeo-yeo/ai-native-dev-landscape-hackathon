Given the success of retrieval-augmented generation in many text-oriented tasks, providing external resources such as library documentation or tutorials can facilitate code generation as well. Despite a few efforts on this, retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) is still under-explored on various tasks and retrieval sources.\n\nIn this work, we conduct a systematic, large-scale analysis by asking: in what scenarios can current retrievers benefit code generation models? and what challenges do they have? We first curate a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, CodeRAG-Bench, encompassing three categories of code generation tasks, including general programming, open-domain, and repository-level problems. We also aggregate documents from five sources for models to retrieve contexts from: competition solutions, online tutorials, library documentation, StackOverflow posts, and GitHub repositories.\n\nWe examine top-performing models on CodeRAG-Bench by providing contexts retrieved from each or multiple sources. Although high-quality contexts can benefit code generation, current retrieval models often struggle to fetch useful contexts, and generation models minimally improve when having limited context lengths or RAG abilities. We hope the community uses CodeRAG-Bench as an effective testbed and continues to build better code-oriented RAG systems to leverage the full power of RACG.", "website_url": "https://code-rag-bench.github.io/", "icon_url": "", "tags": ["OSS", "GA", "Code Benchmark", "AIE"], "verified": false, "oss": true, "popular": false, "date_added": "12/03/2025"}, {"name": "HumanEval", "description": "This is an evaluation harness for the HumanEval problem solving dataset described in the paper \"Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\".", "website_url": "https://github.com/openai/human-eval", "icon_url": "", "tags": ["OSS", "GA", "Code Benchmark", "AIE"], "verified": false, "oss": true, "popular": false, "date_added": "12/03/2025"}, {"name": "SFR-Embedding-Code", "description": "The Salesforce/SFR-Embedding-Code is a generalist embedding model family for multilingual and multi-task code and Text retrieval.
