        engineering teams everywhere. We''ve built an autonomous development solution
        that seamlessly integrates with your existing workflow in under 5 minutes.
        We connect to GitHub, Jira, and other tools you already use.


        Unlike other solutions that focus on the inner loop, we''re tackling the outer
        loop - that overflowing backlog of P2 bugs and features that never get addressed
        because your team is constantly chasing the next deadline. You simply assign
        Bismuth to a ticket, and it autonomously produces high-quality PRs that fix
        issues or implement features. Bismuth also prevents issues from ever getting
        to prod, we scan your codebase and review pull requests for bugs and logic
        issues.


        What makes us different is our background in code analysis, reverse engineering,
        and bug hunting. Our custom code search and special testing methodologies
        catch entire classes of bugs that other solutions miss. We don''t just generate
        code, we create reliable, tested PRs that won''t break your codebase.


        Tech debt cost businesses $1.52T in 2024 alone, with 63% spent on reactive
        fixes after incidents occurred. We''re changing that equation.'

      description: 'Pulumi Copilot is an AI assistant that streamlines cloud infrastructure
        management by combining large language models with semantic cloud understanding.
        Available through both Pulumi Cloud console and CLI, it enables engineers
        to find information and take action on cloud resources using a familiar GPT-like
        interface.


        The tool understands over 160 cloud platforms including AWS, Azure, Google
        Cloud, Kubernetes, and SaaS providers. Key capabilities include generating
        infrastructure code from simple prompts, identifying cost-saving opportunities,
        running compliance checks, and debugging failed stack updates.


        Additionally, Copilot now offers an API that extends its capabilities beyond
        the Pulumi Console. This REST API allows developers to integrate Copilot''s
        infrastructure AI into custom tools, collaboration platforms like Slack and
        Teams, automated workflows, and mobile clients. The API supports multi-turn
        conversations through conversation IDs and requires only basic configuration
        with organization context and resource URLs to function. Currently in preview,
        Pulumi is actively seeking feedback to refine the API before general availability.'

      description: 'Many programs are challenging for language models (LMs) to generate
        using their parametric knowledge alone, yet most works generate programs solely
        based on problem descriptions. Given the success of retrieval-augmented generation
        in many text-oriented tasks, providing external resources such as library
        documentation or tutorials can facilitate code generation as well. Despite
        a few efforts on this, retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) is still
        under-explored on various tasks and retrieval sources.


        In this work, we conduct a systematic, large-scale analysis by asking: in
        what scenarios can current retrievers benefit code generation models? and
        what challenges do they have? We first curate a comprehensive evaluation benchmark,
        CodeRAG-Bench, encompassing three categories of code generation tasks, including
        general programming, open-domain, and repository-level problems. We also aggregate
        documents from five sources for models to retrieve contexts from: competition
        solutions, online tutorials, library documentation, StackOverflow posts, and
        GitHub repositories.


        We examine top-performing models on CodeRAG-Bench by providing contexts retrieved
        from each or multiple sources. Although high-quality contexts can benefit
        code generation, current retrieval models often struggle to fetch useful contexts,
        and generation models minimally improve when having limited context lengths
        or RAG abilities. We hope the community uses CodeRAG-Bench as an effective
        testbed and continues to build better code-oriented RAG systems to leverage
        the full power of RACG.'
